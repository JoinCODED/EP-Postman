# Authorization.

APIs use authorization to ensure that client requests access data securely. This can involve authenticating the sender of a request and verifying that they have permission to access or manipulate the relevant data.

You can pass auth details along with any request you send in Postman. Auth data can be included in the header, body, or as parameters to a request. If you enter your auth details in the Authorization tab, Postman will automatically populate the relevant parts of the request for your chosen auth type.
