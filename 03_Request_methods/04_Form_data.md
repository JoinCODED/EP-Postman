# Form data.

Website forms often send data to APIs as form-data. You can replicate this in Postman using the form-data Body tab. Form data allows you to send key-value pairs, and specify the content type. This is very helpful when your requests require file upload.

1. Select **Body**.
2. Select **form-data**.
3. Enter your **key** name.
4. If you're uploading a file, on the right side next to the value column, there is a dropdown "Text, File", select **File**.
5. Choose your file.
6. Add the rest of your data regularly.

REVIEW: Yanal, change the image so that it has at least one text string.
REVIEW 2: Explain adding an array to a form data.
