Each request you send in Postman requires a URL representing the API endpoint you are working with. Each operation you execute using an API is typically associated with an endpoint. Each endpoint in an API is available at a particular URLâ€”this is what you enter into Postman to access the API.

If you're building an API, the URL will typically be the base location plus path. For example, in our request https://postman-api-learner.glitch.me is the base URL, and `/info` is the endpoint path.

## Selecting request methods

By default Postman will select the **GET** method for new request. **GET** methods are usually for retrieving data from an API. You can use a variety of other methods to send data to your APIs.
