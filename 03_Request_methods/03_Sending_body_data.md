# Sending body data.

You will need to send body data with requests whenever you need to add or update structured data. For example, if you're sending a request to add a new customer to a database, you might include the customer details in JSON. Typically you will use body data with **PUT** and **POST** requests.

The Body tab in Postman allows you to specify the data you need to send with a request. You can send various different types of body data to suit your API.

We are working with javascript so we will use **JSON**.

To create a **POST** request with body data:

1.  Enter our endpoint in the **url** postman-api-learner.glitch.me/info
2.  Select **POST** from the dropdown menu.
3.  From the **body** tab selet raw
4.  From the dropdown menu select **JSON**
5.  Add your data in **JSON** format
6.  **Send**!
