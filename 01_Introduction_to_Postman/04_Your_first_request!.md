You can make requests to APIs in Postman. An API request allows you to retrieve data from a data source, or to send data. APIs run on web servers, and expose endpoints to provide their functionality.

Each API request uses an HTTP method. The most common methods are **GET**, **POST**, **PUT**, and **DELETE**.

-     GET method retrieve data from an API.
-     POST sends new data to an API.
-     PUT method update existing data.
-     DELETE removes existing data.
